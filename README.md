# Heartbeat Module

#### Project Overview

The Heartbeat Module project demonstrates how to interface a heartbeat sensor with an Arduino Mega to detect and monitor heartbeat signals. The heartbeat sensor provides a digital output signal that changes state with each heartbeat detected. This project reads the digital signal from the heartbeat sensor and displays a message on the Serial Monitor whenever a heartbeat is detected.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Heartbeat Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Heartbeat Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** of the heartbeat sensor to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** of the heartbeat sensor to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the heartbeat sensor to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No external libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the heartbeat sensor module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Ensure the heartbeat sensor is correctly positioned and detecting heartbeats.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for messages indicating detected heartbeats.

#### Applications

- **Health Monitoring:** Use in wearable devices for real-time heart rate monitoring.
- **Fitness Trackers:** Integrate into fitness devices to track exercise intensity and recovery.
- **Biofeedback Systems:** Implement in biofeedback devices for stress management and relaxation techniques.
- **Medical Devices:** Use for patient monitoring in medical applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure the heartbeat sensor is securely attached to obtain accurate heartbeat readings.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the rate of checking for heartbeat signals based on your sensor's specifications.
- Experiment with different sensor placements and configurations to optimize heartbeat detection accuracy.
- Calibration may be required based on sensor sensitivity and environmental conditions.
